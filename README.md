# Spotify_API

I am an avid Spotify user and thought it was about time I played around with the Spotify developer console. Through this 
project I was able to have a better understanding of: 

* ENV files
* How to construct authorization tokens 
* How to construct headers
* How to format query calls using the API


Ultimately information concerning the below can be found using the code: 

* Artist name
* List and total markets artist is involved in
* Top tracks and their release date
* Top Album
* Top Albums 
* Related Artists

Replace CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET with your own information using app built with https://developer.spotify.com/
Replace "Artist_Name_Here_From_User_Input" with any band or solo artist to receive information
